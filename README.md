WHAT IT IS:
An Kit with a few tools for "cheating" in Kahoot (sometimes it is cheating, sometimes not really).


INSTALLATION:
git clone https://github.com/LukieHZX/ikahoot_cheat_kit.git
or just download it

pip(3) install KahootPy (for the Spammer and Finder)
pip(3) install requests (for the Answers)

HOW TO USE IT:
Spammer (or sometimes called flouder):

Spams random names into a Kahoot-"Lobby".

python(3) spammer.py
and then type in the name that you want to let it spam in the Kahoot "lobby"
then the "lobby"-ID


Answers:

Gives you the right Answers.

python(3) answers.py
and then type in the quizId of the Quiz. (You can see it in the URL on the teachers/hosts browser: https://play.kahoot.it/v2/start?quizId=THIS_HERE)
then you will see all Questions and the Answers for that question.


Finder:

Finds Kahoot-Games you should not find ;)

python(3) finder.py <RANGE>
Range:
    e.G.: 1111111-9999999
    that means python(3) finder.py 1111111-9999999
    that will take a while, but then you will have all games, but mostly, they will be started then. If a game comes up, you should join right after it comes in the console.
